## ðŸš€ ES6 Features Used

Petopia leverages modern JavaScript (ES6) features for cleaner, more efficient code. Here's a quick overview of the ES6 features employed in this project:

- **Arrow Functions**: Used for concise and readable function expressions.
- **Array Sort**: Implemented for sorting pets by price in descending order.
- **Async-Await**: Ensures smooth asynchronous fetching of pet data from the API.

## ðŸ“Š API Integration

Petopia dynamically fetches pet data from an external API, displaying the data on the site. If any of the fields (e.g., breed, birth date) are missing, placeholders are displayed to ensure a seamless user experience.

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

We prioritized responsiveness for Petopia. The entire site adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Tailwind CSS breakpoints were extensively used for this.
